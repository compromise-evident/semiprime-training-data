Version 3.0.0   Complete re-write, the  "holy cow"  version. Made to match style
                of my ezMNIST. "Generates any training-data & testing-data which
                is semiprimes followed by  more and more  digits of the  smaller
                factor (all preceded by 1 label digit, as text,padded,unpadded.)
