semiprime-training-data



Version 5.1.4   Option 4 - pq label is length n.  (ML.py  has  success in this.)
                Tokenization is now free to tokenize no matter the label length.

Version 5.1.3   Prime length safety; very short primes & semiprimes now allowed.

Version 5.1.2   Excellent random distribution of labels for  option 1,  with the
                cost of being slower to generate.  All distribution  looks good.

Version 5.1.1   Re-ordered options and made them clear, better description. It's
                that important--enough to be a new version; I've had >50% on the
                first option semiprime factorization, where I should have had 10
                percent correctness roughly. So something's  working, need GPUs.

Version 5.1.0   Option 3 - get plain semiprimes labeled with  first digit of the
                smaller factor. (All options are created raw, and ML-tokenized.)

Version 5.0.0   Makes tokenized version for ML.py. It's configurable in the cpp.

Version 4.0.1   Generates primes+composites in random order, not 10101010101010.
                Sep 12 2024

Version 4.0.0   Option to generate primes+composites, for ML recognizing primes.

Version 3.0.0   Complete re-write, the  "holy cow"  version. Made to match style
                of my ezMNIST. "Generates any training-data & testing-data which
                is semiprimes followed by  more and more  digits of the  smaller
                factor (all preceded by 1 label digit, as text,padded,unpadded.)

Version 2.0.0   I'm open to adding rolling-code for secure p[] & q[] randomness.
